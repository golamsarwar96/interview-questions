Q1: What is a Promise in JavaScript?

Answer : 
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
It provides a way to handle asynchronous code more cleanly compared to traditional callbacks.

• 3 Key States of a Promise:
1. Pending:
The initial state of a Promise. It means the operation is still in progress and hasn’t resolved or rejected yet.

2. Fulfilled:
The operation has completed successfully, and the Promise is resolved with a value.

3. Rejected:
The operation has failed, and the Promise is rejected with a reason.


• Common Examples of Promises:
- Fetching data from API

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
